# OpenSARWake

### A SAR ship wake rotation detection benchmark dataset.

OpenSARWake is a benchmark dataset built for ship wake detection. This collection provides 3,973 images containing two polarization modes and 4,096 instances. Most importantly, it encompasses SAR images in the L-, C-, and X-bands, which have not been provided by previous datasets. The images in the dataset have spatial resolutions of 1.25 m to 12.5 m. The image size is 1024× 1024 pixels.
